Stolen Treasure
Here I had a little bit of fun trying to build a castle in the distance and bring some lighting into play. As you can see I can still do a lot more, for now Iâ€™m stopping myself from making more changes or even making it worse I have decided this is as far as I am going on this.

Images to compile this: 18

Hours: 8

This image was done about 8 times when I do not feel happy with it I added another and another thing.

I am still trying to see how I can screenshot it into this just as a smaller or bigger image.
